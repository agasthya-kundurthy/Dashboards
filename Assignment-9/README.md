## Redesign of a Cognitive Walkthrough for Recruiters of MSIS Recruiters.
### Redesigned Visualization

A cognitive walkthrough has been represented as a story to the Recruiters. I had selected specific areas in which to concentrate on,(which I thought would be useful to the Recruiters).

My reasoning for choosing the data to be shown to the recruiters is as follows;

### Program Tracks
I feel that the program tracks play an important role in helping the recruiter understand the general areas of studies that a MSIS student @ SCU goes through. It gives a look at the Domains over which the students gain knowledge of. For example, if a Recruiter is looking for a student who has knowledge over the Business Intelligence Domain, then he can be sure to find students at the MSIS program in this domain.

### Skills of MSIS Students
This part shows the skills that MSIS students have to offer to the recruiter, they are general skills that they offer, these skills might interest a recruiter (they might be relevant to the skills the recruiter is searching for). All the neccessary and important skills are mentioned here because, based on the type of recruiter and the job position that they are offering, the requirements change. So, this gives them an idea of what skills a MSIS student will have.

### Companies MSIS Alumni Work for
This shows a basic list of companies that MSIS Alumni work for, this gives an idea for the recruiters about the companies that recruit from SCU(the level of the company would give them an idea of the level of the students, better companies take better students always). So, this might help them think, if this company is taking students from this place, it tells about the quality of the students. In my original Visualization, I had used bubble charts, but I feel that it is better not to use them and so I have changed the graph to a tree map.

### What do employers think of our Alumni?
This shows the positive experiences that the employers that recruited previously from the MSIS program have, this gives an idea about other possible recruiters (who might be a competitor), how they felt on recruiting a student from SCU, in what areas are these students strong and how to better utilize their talents in these areas.

## Roadmap to the future
The most important factor for any Recruiter to recruit student from a University is the skills of the student and the level of knowledge they posses. I feel that if I had more data on the skills that each and every Program Track offers, that would be very good option and metrics could be developed to help the Recruiters.
