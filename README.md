Introduction:
Motivation:
In the modern world, there are multiple reasons for the demise of human beings. We look at the most common causes of death in the US and at the donations made to charity by people in combating these causes. 

Objective:
The Objective of the visualization is to understand how people donate to various charities that help in combating the most causes of death in the US and which factors might be taken into consideration for making the donation. Heart diseases cause the most number of deaths in the US, but cancer related diseases have higher number of donations. An analysis of the data is required to figure out why this is the case.
The data was gathered from various sources including the original data from the visualization.
Making the Visualization:

There have been several steps in making the visualization, they include

Development Process
The development process includes several steps from forming the initial claim to developing the final visualization, that includes the following
-	Framing the initial claim.
-	Gathering Data for supporting the claim
-	Gathering data from the previous visualization.
-	Gathering data from other sources to further support my claim.
-	Using Jupyter to clean the data and combine new data to form a new dataset.
-	Developing several iterations of visualizations using Tableau.

Data Wrangling Steps
Initially, the data was collected from the previous visualization to understand the purpose of the previous visualization. The data collected had columns which specified the area of the bubbles used in that visualization and these columns were not useful as I did not wish to visualize the data as a bubble chart. I felt that a bar chart would do more justice to the data and make it much easier to compare the number of death due to the common causes of death and donations that these common causes received. This helped me in doing my first Iteration.

I had gathered new data to further understand if there is any impact on the donations made, by the cost of treatment per annum for the common causes of death. This data had been included in the Dataset used for my second Iteration.

For my final Iteration of the project, I had researched on the likelihood of contracting a disease that is part of the most common causes of death. This when compared with the cost of treatment for common causes of death, would give a metric that could be used in reaching a conclusion and validating my claim.

Reasoning and Detours
Heart diseases cause the most number of deaths in the US but when compared to the number of deaths they cause, the donations they receive is lower than what types of cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer receive, although they cause lesser number of deaths. This could have been due to several reasons, when I consider the causes, some factors might be the severity of the cause of death itself or even severity of the treatment for the cause of death, Cancer patients undergo a more severe treatment than other causes, a person affected by cancer would exhibit several symptoms which are visible to the naked eye, like hair fall and other physical changes such as severe loss of weight or constant nausea etc. A person suffering from heart disease might pain of a similar magnitude but might not exhibit symptoms visible to the naked eye. Keeping these in mind, the likeliness of contracting one of the common causes of deaths were considered. This I feel gives a clear picture on which common cause of death has a sense of more common among the population and which is less common and probably causes more burden.

About the Old Visualization

The older version of the Visualization gives us a false impression about the data. It has shortcomings such as using packed bubbles to represent the data and tries to make a comparison under two columns, between donations made to a disease and number of people that die from a different disease and the area of the bubbles is not correct and it doesn’t help in understanding why people donate more to diseases that cause lesser number of deaths.

In my visualization, I have succeeded in understanding why this has been the case and make my claim as – ‘Cancers are less likely but cost more to treat, so they receive higher donations’.

Iterations (Intermediate Prototypes):

In the first Iteration of my visualization, I had considered the data of the number of deaths due to the common causes and what were the donations from charity for the same. This has been represented as a Bar Chart, now it is easier to understand which diseases are getting more money from charity. But this still doesn’t clearly tell me why people donate more to these diseases. This graph is only useful in letting people understand a comparison on number of deaths caused by common causes and money donated from charity to these deaths. 

In the second Iteration of my Visualization, I had added the data of treatment costs per annum for the common causes of death. This gives me an idea about how effective the donations might be. But this also doesn’t explain about why there is a difference in the donation amounts.

Final Visualization:

In the final Iteration of my visualization, I have included the likeliness of contracting(Risk) each of the most common causes of death. This along with the cost of treatment(Cost) lets me know that the highest donations are to diseases that are less likely to occur and at the same time have higher costs of treatment. I have represented this as a scatter plot because, the treatment costs of the disease and the risk of contracting those diseases are two separate entities, there are huge gaps in the costs of treatment and combining these could be effectively shown in a scatter plot. 

In addition to this, I have combined the bar charts of my previous visualizations and changed the representation to a scatter plot which shows the number of deaths caused and donations received by the common causes of death.

Roadmap to the Future:

Now we understand the reason behind donations made by public, why cancers typically get more donations than heart diseases which account for the most number of deaths in the US. A future enhancement for this would be to look at how effective these donations are. Do these donations make a huge difference for the patients suffering from these diseases as whole or they are concentrated only on a set of patients that are lucky enough to receive these donations and if they are sufficient to ensure a long-term solution if possible.
